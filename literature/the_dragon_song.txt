The P&O Dragon song
-------------------------

The light is on in ESAT tonight
No assistent to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I am a nerd
.
Could not get it up, Heaven knows I tried

Don't let it fall
Don't let it ride
Be the dragon you always have to be
.
.
.

Let x-flow, let x-flow
Can't cancel it any more
let x-flow, let x-flow
.
.
.
The bugs didn't bother me anyway!

It's funny how some balancing
Makes everything seems small
And the tears that once controlled us,
Will go away that fast!
It's time to see what it can do
to test the limits and debug again
No flaw, no twist, no itch for it
it works!

Let x-flow, let x-flow
Can't cancel it any more
let x-flow, let x-flow
